# Shanal Cars - Incident Response Plan

## üö® Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

- **P0 - Critical**: System down, payment processing failed, data breach
- **P1 - High**: Major functionality impaired, performance degradation
- **P2 - Medium**: Minor functionality issues, non-critical errors
- **P3 - Low**: Cosmetic issues, minor bugs

### Alert Thresholds

- **Payment Failure Rate > 10%**: P0 Critical
- **Function Timeout Rate > 5%**: P1 High
- **Database Connection Errors**: P0 Critical
- **Webhook Processing Failures > 20%**: P1 High
- **Memory Usage > 80%**: P2 Medium

## üìû Incident Response Team

### Primary Response Team

- **Incident Commander**: Lead Developer
- **Technical Lead**: System Administrator
- **Communication Lead**: Customer Support Manager
- **Business Lead**: Operations Manager

### Escalation Matrix

- **P0/P1**: Immediate notification to all team members
- **P2**: Notification within 1 hour
- **P3**: Notification within 4 hours

## üîÑ Incident Response Workflow

### Phase 1: Detection & Initial Response (0-15 minutes)

1. **Alert Received**

   - Automated monitoring system triggers alert
   - Incident ticket created automatically
   - Response team notified via multiple channels

2. **Initial Assessment**

   - Incident Commander assesses severity
   - Determines if escalation needed
   - Activates response team if P0/P1

3. **Communication**
   - Internal team notification
   - Customer communication if needed
   - Status page update

### Phase 2: Investigation & Mitigation (15-60 minutes)

1. **Technical Investigation**

   - Review monitoring dashboards
   - Check function logs and metrics
   - Analyze error patterns
   - Identify root cause

2. **Immediate Mitigation**

   - Implement workarounds if possible
   - Scale resources if needed
   - Disable problematic features
   - Switch to backup systems

3. **Status Updates**
   - Regular updates to stakeholders
   - Customer communication
   - Progress documentation

### Phase 3: Resolution & Recovery (1-4 hours)

1. **Fix Implementation**

   - Deploy hotfixes if needed
   - Restore services
   - Verify functionality
   - Monitor system stability

2. **Communication**
   - Resolution announcement
   - Customer notification
   - Post-incident summary

### Phase 4: Post-Incident Analysis (24-48 hours)

1. **Post-Mortem Meeting**

   - Timeline reconstruction
   - Root cause analysis
   - Impact assessment
   - Lessons learned

2. **Action Items**
   - Preventive measures
   - Process improvements
   - Documentation updates
   - Training needs

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Response Procedures

### Payment System Incidents

```typescript
// Emergency payment system disable
export const emergencyDisablePayments = functions.https.onCall(
  async (data, context) => {
    if (!isSuperAdmin(context.auth.uid)) {
      throw new functions.https.HttpsError(
        "permission-denied",
        "Super Admin access required"
      );
    }

    // Disable payment link generation
    await admin
      .firestore()
      .collection("system_config")
      .doc("payments")
      .update({
        enabled: false,
        disabledAt: admin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
        disabledBy: context.auth.uid,
        reason: data.reason || "Emergency disable",
      });

    // Log incident
    await admin.firestore().collection("incidents").add({
      type: "payment_system_disabled",
      severity: "P0",
      initiatedBy: context.auth.uid,
      reason: data.reason,
      timestamp: admin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
    });

    return { success: true, message: "Payment system disabled" };
  }
);
```

### Database Recovery Procedures

```typescript
// Emergency database backup and recovery
export const emergencyDatabaseBackup = functions.https.onCall(
  async (data, context) => {
    if (!isSuperAdmin(context.auth.uid)) {
      throw new functions.https.HttpsError(
        "permission-denied",
        "Super Admin access required"
      );
    }

    try {
      // Export critical collections
      const collections = ["bookings", "users", "admin_logs"];
      const backupData = {};

      for (const collection of collections) {
        const snapshot = await admin.firestore().collection(collection).get();
        backupData[collection] = snapshot.docs.map((doc) => ({
          id: doc.id,
          data: doc.data(),
        }));
      }

      // Store backup
      await admin
        .firestore()
        .collection("emergency_backups")
        .add({
          timestamp: admin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
          createdBy: context.auth.uid,
          collections: Object.keys(backupData),
          data: backupData,
        });

      return { success: true, collections: Object.keys(backupData) };
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Emergency backup failed:", error);
      throw new functions.https.HttpsError("internal", "Backup failed");
    }
  }
);
```
